        <h1>Discord bot</h1>
        <p>I developed the bot in python and it currently runs on the same computer that is hosting this website. I programmed it just to see what i could do with it so 
            its a bit of a jumbled mess of different abilities with no singular focus. For example it can play roulette, give info on the stock market, set reminders and a tone of other stuff that 
            will be explained later. 
        </p>

        <h2>Roulette</h2>
        <p>the most advanced and most empressive function of the bot is its ability to play roulette. I also programmed a points system that
             is able to accuratly track all palyers scores and create leaderboards. If the player runs out of points, it also has the !work function that will select 
             a number between 1000 and 10000 at random to give the user.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Usage: !roulette (bet amount) (number/color)
        </p>
        <p>For example: !roulette 1000 red</p>

        <h2>stock market functions</h2>
        <p>The bot also has the ability to give accurate and up to date
            stock market data. The only issue right now is that the historic 
            data is basicaly unreadable but that will get fixed soon.
